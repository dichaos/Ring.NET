# Ring.NET
A library to Access Ring data. 

This is my pet project which I started during the [2020 coronavirus outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic). It is by no means an official [Ring](ring.com) library. 
This library includes two projects the Ring.NET that can extract information from a ring doorbell and chimes (these are the only devices I currentyly have) and a [face detection](https://github.com/takuya-takeuchi/FaceRecognitionDotNet) functionality.
